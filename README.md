# Eats-Website-Prototype

This is a website for LocalEats, an initiative that will help local restaurants to reach a wider market which
they would not be able to reach on their own due to the existence of large-chain franchises. 
The website is a prototype of the website that will be used by the local restaurants to advertise their food and
to reach out to the customers.

The website is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is responsive and can be viewed on any device.
